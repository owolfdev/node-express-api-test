To deploy your Express.js API on Google Cloud, specifically using Google App Engine, you can follow these steps:

1. Set Up a Google Cloud Project:
   If you haven't already, create a Google Cloud account and set up a new project in the Google Cloud Console.

2. Install the Google Cloud SDK:
   Install the Google Cloud SDK, which provides the necessary command-line tools for deploying to Google Cloud. You can find installation instructions in the official documentation: [Google Cloud SDK Installation](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install).

3. Initialize your Project:
   In your Express.js project's root directory, run the following command to initialize your project with Google Cloud:

   ```
   gcloud init
   ```

   Follow the prompts to select your Google Cloud project and configure authentication.

4. Configure App Engine:
   Create an `app.yaml` file in your project's root directory. This file specifies the configuration for the App Engine deployment. Here's an example `app.yaml` file:

   ```yaml
   runtime: nodejs16

   instance_class: F2

   env_variables:
     PORT: 8080
   ```

   Customize the `app.yaml` file as per your project's requirements. You can specify the desired Node.js runtime version, instance class, and environment variables.

5. Deploy your API:
   Use the following command to deploy your Express.js API to Google App Engine:

   ```
   gcloud app deploy
   ```

   The deployment process may take a few minutes. Once completed, Google Cloud will provide you with the URL where your API is deployed.

6. Test and Verify:
   Visit the provided URL to test your deployed Express.js API and ensure it's functioning correctly.

Remember to consult the official Google Cloud documentation for detailed instructions and more advanced configuration options. Deploying on Google Cloud may involve additional steps depending on your project's requirements, such as setting up databases or configuring networking.

7. Re-deploy

```
  gcloud app deploy
```

```yaml
runtime: nodejs16

instance_class: F2

env_variables:
  PORT: 8080
  NOTION_API_KEY: "secret_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
  NOTION_DATABASE_ID: "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
```
